 QUICK START
---------------
1) Start the server by executing “server.sh” (or “server.bat” if you’re using
   Windows) under the “bin” directory. On most of OS you can just double click
   on it.
2) Type in the terminal the password you want to assign to the “root” user. This
   is needed only the first time.
2) To Open Studio Web Tool, open a browser and point it to the URL:
   http://localhost:2480
3) You can also use the console, it’s in “bin” directory. Launch “console.sh”
   (or “console.bat” if you’re using Windows)

We suggest to use Java version 8 because it's much faster than Java 6 and 7.
