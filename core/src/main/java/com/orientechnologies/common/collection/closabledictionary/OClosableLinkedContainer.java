  /**
   * Design of container consist of several major parts.
   *
   * Operation buffers.
   *
   * Operation buffers are needed to log all events inside of container which may cause changes in content and order
   * of LRU items. Following operations are logged:
   * 1. Add.
   * 2. Remove.
   * 3. Acquire.
   *
   * Instead of logging all of these operations using single buffer (logger) we split logging by several buffers.
   * So only few threads are logging at any buffer at the same moment reducing chance of contention.
   *
   * There are two types of buffers : state buffer and read buffers. State buffer is used to log operations which can not be lost such
   * as add and remove. Read buffers are used to log operations small part of which may be lost.
   *
   * As result write buffer is implemented as concurrent linked queue and read buffers are implemented as arrays with
   * two types of counters. So in nutshell read buffer is array based implementation of ring buffer.
   * Counters have following meaning : write counter - next position inside of array which is used to write in buffer entry
   * which was accessed as result of acquire operation, read counter - next position inside of array which is used to read data from
   * buffer during flushing of data. So this buffer is the implementation of Lamport queue algorithm not taking into account that we may work
   * with several producers. To decrease contention between threads we do not perform CAS operations on write counter during
   * operation logging. As result threads may overwrite logs of each other which is acceptable because part of statistic
   * may be lost.
   *
   * Content of all buffers is processed (flushed) when one of the read buffers is reached threshold between position of write
   * counter during last buffer flush (this position is stored at "drain at write count" field associated with each buffer)
   * and current position of write counter. Buffers also flushed when we log any operation in write buffer.
   *
   * There is no common lock between of operations with data and logging of those operations to buffers so related records can be reordered
   * during processing of buffers. For example we may add item in t1 thread and remove item in t2 thread. But operations logged in buffers
   * may be processed in different order and record removed from cache may stay in LRU list forever. To avoid given situation state machine
   * was introduced.
   *
   * Each entry has following states: open, closed, retired (removed from map but not from LRU list), dead(completely removed),
   * acquired.
   *
   * Following state transitions are allowed:
   *
   * open->(evict() method is called during buffer flush)->close
   * closed->(acquire() method is called)->acquired
   * acquired->(release())->open
   *
   * open->(remove())->retired
   * closed->(remove())->retired
   * acquired->(remove())->retired
   *
   * It is seen from state flow that it is impossible to close item in "acquired" state.
   * Also during of processing of "add" operation, item will be added into LRU list only if it is in
   *
   * LRU list is modified during flush of the buffers , to make those modifications safe flush of the buffer
   * is performed under exclusive lock. To avoid contention between threads any thread which has been noticed that read buffer should
   * be drained calls tryLock but not lock operation.
