<body>Contains all the class involved on the "local" implementation of the OStorage interface. The OStorageLocal store record into the disk
	using OClusterLocal and ODataLocal classes. Physical clusters need separate files. Access is faster than the logical cluster but the database size is

	entities should be stored inside a physical cluster.
