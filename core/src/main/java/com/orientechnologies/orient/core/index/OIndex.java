  /**
   * Returns amount of times when index was rebuilt since storage was opened.
   * <p>
   * It is used to support so called "live index rebuild" feature.
   * <p>
   * Value of this version is increased every time when index is going to be rebuild.
   * So if two sequential calls of this method return different numbers it means that index at least started to rebuild
   * itself.
   * <p>
   * If you use indexes to increase speed of fetching data from database you should follow following workflow:
   * <ol>
   * <li>Read index rebuild version.</li>
   * <li>Check index rebuild flag {@link #isRebuilding()}, if it is true, do not use index and fetch data directly from
   * database clusters.</li>
   * <li>Fetch data from index.</li>
   * <li>Read index rebuild version again, if it is not equal to version which was read at first time, go to step 2.
   * It is VERY important do not reorder steps 1 and 2.
   * Such recording may lead to situation when index is rebuilding but we miss this state.</li>
   * </ol>
   * <p>
   * This approach works well ONLY if you do not use methods which return {@link OIndexCursor} instance.
   * In case of you work with cursors index rebuild may cause data inconsistency issues in both:
   * <ol>
   * <li>Code which calls index methods to create cursor (can be avoided using steps are listed above)</li>
   * <li>During iteration over the cursor itself</li>
   * </ol>
   * <p>
   * To detect last data inconsistency issue please use cursor wrapper
   * {@link OIndexChangesWrapper} which throws {@link com.orientechnologies.orient.core.exception.OIndexIsRebuildingException}
   * in case of index rebuild.
   * <p>
   * Both of these approaches are used in implementation of support of "live index rebuild" for <code>SELECT</code> SQL queries.
   * <ol>
   * <li>In case of index which we are going to use to speed up <code>SELECT</code> query is rebuilding
   * we skip this index.</li>
   * <li>If index is rebuilding at the moment when we iterate over the cursor
   * we catch {@link com.orientechnologies.orient.core.exception.OIndexIsRebuildingException} exception
   * and retry whole query again.</li>
