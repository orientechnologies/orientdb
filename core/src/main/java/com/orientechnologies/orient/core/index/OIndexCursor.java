/**
 * Presentation of OrientDB index cursor for point and range queries. Cursor may iterate by several elements even if you do point
 * query (query by single key). It is possible if you use not unique index.
 * 
 * Contract of cursor is simple it iterates in some subset of index data till it reaches it's borders in such case
 * {@link #nextEntry()} returns <code>null</code>.
 * 
 * Cursor is created as result of index query method such as
 * {@link com.orientechnologies.orient.core.index.OIndex#iterateEntriesBetween(Object, boolean, Object, boolean, boolean)} cursor
 * instance can not be used at several threads simultaneously.
