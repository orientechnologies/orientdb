Lucene indexes for OrientDB

Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text and spatial search, especially cross-platform. For Lucene documentation visit please [https://lucene.apache.org/](https://lucene.apache.org/).


This project aims to bring the power of Lucene index into [OrientDB](https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb). OrientDB does provide its own index engine for classic indexes like unique, notunique and dictionary. This goal of ths project is not replacing OrientDB internal indexing system, but rather extending it throught Lucene to support Full-Text and Spatial.

Two types of indexes are supported:

1. Full text index
2. Spatial Index
